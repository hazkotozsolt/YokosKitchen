                <p class="about">
                    Yoko, born in a Japanese family, is an enthusiastic food lover, who likes to teach, just as much
                    as
                    she
                    loves to cook.
                    Everything started at her teenage years, when she first tried to cook something for her family,
                    which
                    turned out great.
                    After that, she quickly developed it as a habit, and she wanted to turn her hobby, her passion
                    into
                    her
                    dream job.

                <p class="about">Yoko tried to dream big, and she founded her school, Yoko's Kitchen, with the
                    support
                    of
                    her family and friends in 2011.
